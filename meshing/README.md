# SPECFEM3D MESHING
The following utilities are used for meshing cartesian meshes for SPECFEM3D 
Cartesian. There are utilities to generate meshfem3D files, topography files
for your top interface, and to apply stochastic perturbations to an external
tomography model (.xyz). See each of the main functions for detailed 
instructions, but this README provides some basic intro, because inevitebly I 
will forget what I did
