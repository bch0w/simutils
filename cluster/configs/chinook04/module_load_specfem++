# Module mismatches, ztd/1.5.2 is req. for Boost/1.79.0, but that requires
# GCCcore/11.3.0, but GCCcore/12.3.0 is required for Doxygen, so it seems like
# I can only have one or the other at the moment. SPECFEM++ installs its own
# version of Boost though so for now I will leave it alone
# module load GCC/11.3.0      # req. for Boost/1.79.0


module load intel/2023a     # req. for HDF5
module load GCCcore/12.3.0  # req. for Doxygen, probably already in from intel
module load HDF5/1.14.0
