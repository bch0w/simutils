1/23/24 SPECFEM3D_GLOBE v8.1.0
Readme to make source code edits to allow 1D PREM as the starting GLL model

Motivation:
The standard GLL starting model is S362ANI + Crust2.0. This combination of 
models defines a standard meshing structure (nelements, moho topography etc.).
When you set model==gll in the Par_file, SPECFEM will build its initial mesh 
based on this model combination, and then attempt to interpolate the GLL model
onto this domain. If, however, you have created your GLL model with a model that
does NOT have the structure of S362ANI + Crust2.0 (essentially any other model),
then the interplation/expected number of elements/mesh partitioning will all be
incorrect, and the outputted mesh will essentially be unordered/shuffled.

This modification of the source code creates a new 'GLL' style model that 
expects the mesh structure of 1D TISO PREM, such that the starting GLL model
you use in your inversion can be a 1D model. This is useful for synthetic 
or toy problem inversions.


Steps:
* Add the following lines to the src file: src/shared/get_model_parameters.F90
below the lines

  # L325 or so
  ! model specifics
  select case (trim(MODEL_NAME))

  !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  !
  ! CUSTOM MODELS: 
  !
  ! Apply structure from 1D PREM onto a GLL mesh that can then be used for 
  ! iterative inversions by turning off 3D mesh manipulations for GLL models.
  !
  !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  !!! CUSTOM - Allow 1D PREM to be used in conjunction with GLL model
  case ('custom_1d_transversely_isotropic_prem')
    ONE_CRUST = .false.  ! true = 1 crust layer; false = 2 crust layers
    CASE_3D = .false.   ! true = more GLL points / km in upper crust
    CRUSTAL = .false.   ! true: 3D crustal model; false: 1D crustal model
    MODEL_3D_MANTLE_PERTUBATIONS = .false.   ! true: perturb ref mantle model
    TRANSVERSE_ISOTROPY = .true.

  !!! CUSTOM - Turn off 3D mesh properties, compatible with 1D PREM
  case ('custom_gll')
    ONE_CRUST = .false.  ! default .true.
    CASE_3D = .false.    ! default .true.
    CRUSTAL = .false.    ! default .true.
    MODEL_3D_MANTLE_PERTUBATIONS = .false.   ! default .true.
    ! The following parameters have not been modified
    TRANSVERSE_ISOTROPY = .true.  ! same as reference model
    MODEL_GLL = .true.
    MODEL_GLL_TYPE = 2 ! (2 == tiso) input model files are tiso
    REFERENCE_1D_MODEL = GLL_REFERENCE_1D_MODEL
    THREE_D_MODEL = THREE_D_MODEL_GLL

* Modify setup/constants.h
    - USE_1D_REFERENCE = .true.
    - Uncomment (and comment the S362ANI part)
          integer, parameter :: GLL_REFERENCE_1D_MODEL = REFERENCE_MODEL_PREM
          integer, parameter :: GLL_REFERENCE_MODEL = REFERENCE_MODEL_PREM
* Remove old make files (obj/) and remove `bin/xmeshfem3D`
* run $ make xmeshfem3D 
* Create starting mesh with xmeshfem3D using Par_file model==`custom_1d...`
* Put all resulting DATABASES_MPI files into DATA/GLL
* Create GLL mesh with xmeshfem3D and Par_file model==`custom_gll` 
* Double check mesh files look good with ParaView + .vtk files
